## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were considered and why were they rejected?]
```

## Decision Criteria

Architectural decisions are evaluated based on:

1. **Technical Merit**: Does it solve the problem effectively?
2. **Maintainability**: Can the team support it long-term?
3. **Scalability**: Will it handle growth requirements?
4. **Security**: Does it meet security standards?
5. **Cost**: Is it cost-effective to implement and operate?
6. **Risk**: What are the risks and mitigation strategies?
7. **Team Expertise**: Does the team have the skills to implement it?
