# CI/CD and Test Configuration Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the CI/CD pipeline and test configurations to resolve issues with Python dependencies, test implementations, coverage reporting, security scans, and frontend testing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python Dependencies Installation ✅

**Problem**: Missing development dependencies and incorrect installation paths in CI/CD workflows.

**Solutions**:
- Created `/pipelines/requirements-dev.txt` with all necessary testing dependencies
- Updated CI workflows to properly install both main and dev dependencies
- Added proper pip upgrade commands in all workflows
- Fixed cache dependency paths to include both requirements files

**Files Modified**:
- `pipelines/requirements-dev.txt` (created)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml`

### 2. Missing Test Implementations ✅

**Problem**: Test files referenced classes and methods that weren't fully implemented.

**Solutions**:
- Enhanced `pipelines/dedup/lsh_index.py` with complete LSHDeduplicator class
- Added proper interface methods (add_document, query_similar, remove_document)
- Implemented full LSH functionality with MinHash and similarity search
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- `pipelines/dedup/lsh_index.py`

### 3. Coverage Report Generation ✅

**Problem**: Inconsistent coverage reporting configuration and incorrect file paths.

**Solutions**:
- Enhanced `coverage.config.js` with unified coverage configuration
- Fixed coverage output paths in CI workflows
- Updated pytest coverage commands to use correct directory structure
- Configured proper coverage thresholds and reporting formats

**Files Modified**:
- `coverage.config.js`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml`

### 4. Security Scan Configuration ✅

**Problem**: Security tools were failing due to missing configuration and incompatible commands.

**Solutions**:
- Updated bandit to use proper configuration (`bandit[toml]`)
- Fixed safety command syntax for JSON output
- Added proper error handling with appropriate exit codes
- Created security test payload fixtures

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `tests/fixtures/security/xss_payloads.json` (created)
- `tests/fixtures/security/sql_payloads.json` (created)

### 5. Frontend Test Configuration ✅

**Problem**: Missing Playwright configuration at the correct location and suboptimal CI settings.

**Solutions**:
- Created proper `playwright.config.js` at site root level
- Configured CI-optimized settings (single browser, timeouts, etc.)
- Set up proper test artifact collection and reporting
- Fixed test server startup configuration

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/site/playwright.config.js` (created)

### 6. Test Environment Setup ✅

**Problem**: Inconsistent environment setup and path configuration in CI.

**Solutions**:
- Fixed PYTHONPATH setup in all test workflows
- Corrected working directory changes in test commands
- Ensured proper test database setup and configuration
- Added missing environment variables for test isolation

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml`

### 7. Test Fixture Files ✅

**Problem**: Missing security test payloads referenced in test configuration.

**Solutions**:
- Created comprehensive XSS payload test cases
- Added SQL injection test payloads with severity classification
- Included both malicious and safe content for validation testing
- Added proper test configuration settings

**Files Created**:
- `tests/fixtures/security/xss_payloads.json`
- `tests/fixtures/security/sql_payloads.json`

## Configuration Details

### Python Dependencies Structure

```
pipelines/
├── requirements.txt          # Main production dependencies
└── requirements-dev.txt      # Development and testing dependencies
```

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Global**: 95% coverage for all metrics
- **Critical modules** (dedup): 98% coverage
- **AI-dependent modules** (enrich): 90% coverage
- **Other modules**: 95% coverage

### Security Testing

- **XSS Payloads**: 22 test cases covering script injection, event handlers, etc.
- **SQL Injection**: 22 test cases covering union attacks, blind injection, etc.
- **Expected block rate**: 85-90% for malicious payloads
- **False positive tolerance**: 1-2 cases

### Frontend Testing Configuration

- **Unit tests**: Vitest with 95% coverage requirement
- **E2E tests**: Playwright with Chromium (CI) or multi-browser (local)
- **Test isolation**: Proper setup/teardown and mocking
- **Accessibility testing**: Built into component tests

## Quality Gates

### CI Pipeline Success Criteria

1. ✅ Code quality checks pass (formatting, linting, type checking)
2. ✅ Build validation succeeds (Astro build + TypeScript compilation)
3. ✅ Content validation passes (schema validation, link checking)
4. ✅ Python pipeline tests pass (unit + integration)
5. ✅ Security scans complete without critical issues
6. ✅ Frontend tests pass (unit + E2E)
7. ✅ Coverage thresholds are met (95% minimum)

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Build time**: < 15 minutes total pipeline
- **Test execution**: < 5 minutes for unit tests
- **Coverage generation**: < 2 minutes
- **Security scanning**: < 3 minutes

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Python pipeline tests
cd pipelines
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Frontend unit tests
cd apps/site
npm install
npm run test:unit:coverage

# Frontend E2E tests
cd apps/site
npm run test:e2e

# Security tests
bandit -r pipelines/ -f json -o security-report.json
safety check --json --output safety-report.json
```

### Coverage Reports

- **Python**: `coverage/html-report/index.html`
- **Frontend**: `apps/site/coverage/index.html`
- **Combined**: Available via CI artifacts

### Security Reports

- **Bandit**: `pipelines/bandit-report.json`
- **Safety**: `pipelines/safety-report.json`
- **npm audit**: Available via `npm audit` in `apps/site/`

## Monitoring and Alerts

- **Codecov**: Automatic coverage reporting and PR comments
- **GitHub Security**: SARIF upload for vulnerability scanning
- **Test Reporter**: JUnit XML reports for test result visualization
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI for frontend performance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Performance optimization**: Monitor build times and optimize slow steps
2. **Test parallelization**: Implement better parallel test execution
3. **Cache optimization**: Improve dependency caching strategies
4. **Security enhancements**: Add more comprehensive security testing
5. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation updated as the codebase evolves

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Ensure PYTHONPATH is correctly set
2. **Database connection failures**: Check PostgreSQL service in CI
3. **Timeout issues**: Increase timeouts for slow operations
4. **Coverage fluctuations**: Check for non-deterministic test behavior
5. **Security false positives**: Update security test payloads as needed

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Debug pytest with verbose output
pytest -vvv --tb=long --log-cli-level=DEBUG

# Debug Vitest with detailed output
npm run test:unit -- --reporter=verbose --no-coverage

# Debug Playwright with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Check pipeline module imports
python -c "from pipelines.dedup.simhash import SimHashDeduplicator; print('Import successful')"
```

All fixes have been implemented and tested to ensure the CI/CD pipeline runs smoothly with comprehensive test coverage and security validation.
