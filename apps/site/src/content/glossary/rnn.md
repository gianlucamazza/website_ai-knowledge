## What is a Recurrent Neural Network

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining an
internal memory state that persists across time steps. Unlike feedforward neural networks that process input
independently, RNNs have recurrent connections that allow information to flow from previous time steps, enabling them to
capture temporal patterns and dependencies in sequential data.

## Core Concepts

### Sequential Data Processing

**Sequential Data Characteristics**:

- Data points have temporal or sequential relationships
- Order matters for understanding meaning
- Variable-length sequences common
- Context from previous elements influences current processing

**Examples of Sequential Data**:

- Text: Words in sentences, characters in words
- Speech: Audio samples over time
- Time series: Stock prices, weather data, sensor readings
- Video: Frames in temporal sequence

### Memory and State

**Hidden State**:

- Internal memory that persists across time steps
- Encodes information from previous inputs
- Updated at each time step
- Allows network to "remember" past information

**State Update Process**:

```text
h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t)

```text
Where:

- h_t = hidden state at time t
- h_{t-1} = previous hidden state
- x_t = input at time t
- f = activation function

### Recurrent Connections

**Temporal Links**:

- Connections from neurons to themselves across time
- Enable information flow from past to present
- Create cycles in the network graph
- Distinguish RNNs from feedforward networks

## RNN Architecture

### Basic RNN Structure

**Components**:

- Input layer: Receives sequential inputs
- Hidden layer: Maintains internal state
- Output layer: Produces predictions
- Recurrent connections: Link time steps

**Mathematical Formulation**:

```text
h_t = tanh(W_h * h_{t-1} + W_x * x_t + b)
y_t = W_y * h_t + b_y

```text
Where:

- W_h = hidden-to-hidden weight matrix
- W_x = input-to-hidden weight matrix
- W_y = hidden-to-output weight matrix
- b, b_y = bias vectors

### Unfolding Through Time

**Temporal Unrolling**:

- RNN can be "unfolded" into feedforward network
- Each time step becomes a layer
- Weights are shared across time steps
- Enables standard backpropagation training

**Computation Graph**:

```text
x_1 -> [RNN] -> h_1 -> y_1
       ^  |
       |  v
x_2 -> [RNN] -> h_2 -> y_2
       ^  |
       |  v
x_3 -> [RNN] -> h_3 -> y_3

```text

## Types of RNN Architectures

### One-to-One

- Single input, single output
- Not truly sequential (equivalent to feedforward)
- Rarely used in practice

### One-to-Many

- Single input, sequence of outputs
- Examples: Image captioning, music generation
- Input processed once, outputs generated sequentially

### Many-to-One

- Sequence of inputs, single output
- Examples: Sentiment analysis, document classification
- Process entire sequence, output final prediction

### Many-to-Many (Synchronized)

- Input and output sequences of same length
- Examples: Part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition
- Output at each time step

### Many-to-Many (Encoder-Decoder)

- Input and output sequences of different lengths
- Examples: Machine translation, text summarization
- Encoder processes input, decoder generates output

## Training RNNs

### Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

**Process**:

1. Unfold RNN through time
2. Forward pass computes outputs and states
3. Calculate loss across all time steps
4. Backward pass propagates gradients
5. Update shared parameters

**Gradient Computation**:

- Gradients flow backward through time
- Chain rule applied across temporal connections
- Parameters updated based on accumulated gradients

**Truncated BPTT**:

- Limit backpropagation to fixed number of time steps
- Reduces computational complexity
- May miss long-term dependencies

### Challenges in Training

#### Vanishing Gradient Problem

**Problem Description**:

- Gradients shrink exponentially as they propagate backward
- Early time steps receive very small updates
- Network fails to learn long-term dependencies

**Mathematical Explanation**:

```text
∂L/∂h_1 = ∂L/∂h_T * ∏(t=2 to T) ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1}

```text
If derivatives < 1, product becomes very small

**Solutions**:

- Gradient clipping
- Better initialization
- Advanced architectures (LSTM, GRU)
- Skip connections

#### Exploding Gradient Problem

**Problem Description**:

- Gradients grow exponentially during backpropagation
- Causes unstable training
- Parameters receive massive updates

**Solutions**:

- **Gradient Clipping**: Cap gradient magnitude
- **L2 Regularization**: Penalize large weights
- **Lower Learning Rates**: Reduce update step size

## RNN Variants

### Bidirectional RNNs

**Concept**:

- Process sequence in both forward and backward directions
- Combine information from past and future
- Better context understanding

**Architecture**:

- Two separate RNNs: forward and backward
- Outputs concatenated or combined
- Requires entire sequence to be available

**Applications**:

- Named entity recognition

### Deep RNNs

**Multi-layer Structure**:

- Increased representational capacity

**Benefits**:

- More expressive models

**Challenges**:

### Attention Mechanisms

**Motivation**:

- RNNs struggle with very long sequences
- Fixed-size hidden state becomes bottleneck
- Attention allows selective focus on relevant parts

**How Attention Works**:

1. Compute attention scores for each input position
2. Create weighted average of hidden states
3. Use context vector for prediction
4. Dynamically focus on relevant information
