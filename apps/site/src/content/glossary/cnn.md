## What is a Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of deep neural network particularly effective for processing
data with grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs use mathematical operations called convolutions to detect local
features, making them highly successful in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and
medical image analysis.

## Key Innovations

### Biological Inspiration

CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex of animals:

**Receptive Fields**:

- Neurons respond to specific regions of the visual field
- Overlapping receptive fields create complete coverage
- Hierarchical processing from simple to complex features

**Feature Detection**:

- Simple cells detect edges and orientations
- Complex cells detect patterns and motion
- Higher-level cells recognize objects and faces

### Translation Invariance

**Spatial Invariance**:

- Ability to recognize patterns regardless of position
- Same feature detector applied across entire image
- Robust to small translations and distortions

**Parameter Sharing**:

- Same filter weights used across spatial locations
- Dramatically reduces number of parameters
- Enables learning from smaller datasets

## Core Components

### Convolutional Layers

**Convolution Operation**:

- Slide learnable filters (kernels) across input
- Compute dot product between filter and local region
- Produce feature maps highlighting detected patterns

**Mathematical Formulation**:

```text
(I * K)(i,j) = ΣΣ I(m,n) × K(i-m, j-n)

```text
Where:

- I = input image/feature map
- K = kernel/filter
- * denotes convolution operation

**Key Parameters**:

- **Filter Size**: Typically 3×3, 5×5, or 7×7
- **Stride**: Step size when sliding filter (usually 1 or 2)
- **Padding**: Add zeros around input to control output size
- **Number of Filters**: Determines depth of output volume

### Activation Functions

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**:

```text
f(x) = max(0, x)

```text
- Most common activation in CNNs
- Introduces non-linearity
- Helps with gradient flow
- Computationally efficient

**Other Activations**:

- **Leaky ReLU**: f(x) = max(0.01x, x)
- **ELU**: Exponential Linear Unit
- **Swish**: f(x) = x × sigmoid(x)

### Pooling Layers

**Purpose**:

- Reduce spatial dimensions of feature maps
- Decrease computational load
- Provide translation invariance
- Control overfitting

**Max Pooling**:

**Average Pooling**:

- Smoother dimensionality reduction
- Less aggressive than max pooling

**Global Pooling**:

- Pool entire feature map to single value
- Often used before final classification layer
- Reduces overfitting

### Fully Connected Layers

**Purpose**:

- Perform final classification or regression
- Combine features learned by convolutional layers
- Map features to output classes

**Typical Structure**:
