## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, solving problems, and making decisions. AI aims to create machines that can simulate cognitive functions associated with human minds.

## Core Capabilities

### Perception

AI systems can interpret and understand their environment through various inputs:

- **Computer Vision**: Analyzing and understanding visual information from images and videos
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken words to text and understanding intent
- **Sensor Data Processing**: Interpreting data from various sensors and devices

### Reasoning and Problem-Solving

AI systems can process information logically to reach conclusions:

- **Logical Inference**: Drawing conclusions from given premises
- **Planning**: Creating sequences of actions to achieve goals
- **Decision Making**: Choosing optimal actions based on available information
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Finding solutions within defined limitations

### Learning and Adaptation

AI systems can improve their performance through experience:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring structures in data
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Building understanding from examples
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving accuracy and efficiency over time
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge from one domain to another

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

### Based on Capabilities

**Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
- Designed for specific tasks or domains
- Current state of most AI systems
- Examples: Chess programs, recommendation systems, image recognition

**General AI (Strong AI)**
- Human-level intelligence across all cognitive tasks
- Theoretical goal not yet achieved
- Would match human cognitive abilities in all areas

**Superintelligence**

- No memory of past experiences
- Example: IBM's Deep Blue chess computer

**Limited Memory**
- Can use past experiences to inform current decisions
- Most current AI systems fall into this category
- Example: Self-driving cars using recent traffic data

**Theory of Mind**
- Understanding that others have beliefs and desires
- Current research frontier
- Would enable more natural human-AI interaction

**Self-Aware**
- Consciousness and self-understanding
- Theoretical and highly speculative
- Would represent the pinnacle of AI development
