## What is Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in
the direction of steepest descent. In machine learning, it's the primary method for training models by minimizing loss
functions, adjusting parameters to reduce the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. The algorithm uses the
mathematical concept of gradients to determine the direction and magnitude of parameter updates.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Gradient

**Definition**: The gradient ∇f(x) is a vector of partial derivatives that points in the direction of steepest increase
of function f at point x.

**For scalar function f(x)**:

```text
∇f(x) = df/dx

```text
**For multivariate function f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)**:

```text
∇f(x) = [∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ..., ∂f/∂xₙ]ᵀ

```text
**Key Properties**:

- Points in direction of steepest increase
- Magnitude indicates rate of change
- Perpendicular to level curves/surfaces

### The Algorithm

**Basic Update Rule**:

```text
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α ∇f(θ_t)

```text
Where:

- θ = parameters to optimize
- α = learning rate (step size)
- ∇f(θ_t) = gradient at current point
- t = iteration number

**Intuition**: Move in opposite direction of gradient (steepest decrease) to minimize the function.

## Core Concepts

### Learning Rate (α)

**Critical Hyperparameter**:

- Controls step size in parameter space
- Too large: overshooting, oscillation, divergence
- Too small: slow convergence, stuck in plateaus

**Choosing Learning Rate**:

- Start with common values: 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001
- Use learning rate schedules
- Adaptive methods adjust automatically

**Visual Analogy**:

- Imagine rolling a ball down a hill to reach the bottom
- Learning rate determines how big steps the ball takes
- Large steps might overshoot the valley; small steps take longer

### Convergence Criteria

**When to Stop**:

1. **Gradient magnitude**: |∇f(θ)| < ε
2. **Parameter change**: |θ_{t+1} - θ_t| < ε
3. **Function value change**: |f(θ_{t+1}) - f(θ_t)| < ε
4. **Maximum iterations**: Prevent infinite loops

**Practical Considerations**:

- Combine multiple criteria
- Monitor validation metrics
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

### Local vs Global Minima

**Local Minimum**:

- Lowest point in neighborhood
- Gradient descent can get stuck
- Common in non-convex functions

**Global Minimum**:

- Lowest point over entire domain
- Guaranteed for convex functions
- Not guaranteed for neural networks

**Escaping Local Minima**:

- Random restarts
- Momentum-based methods
- Stochastic gradient descent noise

## Variants of Gradient Descent

### Batch Gradient Descent

**Full Dataset Processing**:

- Uses entire training dataset for each update
- Computes exact gradient
- Stable but computationally expensive

**Algorithm**:

```text
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    gradient = compute_gradient(entire_dataset, θ)
    θ = θ - α * gradient

```text
**Advantages**:

- Stable convergence
- Guaranteed to converge for convex functions
- Smooth gradient estimates

**Disadvantages**:

- Slow for large datasets
- Memory intensive
- May get stuck in local minima

### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

**Single Sample Processing**:

- Uses one random sample for each update
- Approximates gradient with single example
- Fast but noisy updates

**Algorithm**:

```text
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for sample in randomly_shuffle(dataset):
        gradient = compute_gradient(sample, θ)
        θ = θ - α * gradient

```text
**Advantages**:

- Fast updates
- Can escape local minima due to noise
- Memory efficient
- Online learning capability

**Disadvantages**:

- Noisy gradients
- May not converge precisely
- Sensitive to learning rate

### Mini-batch Gradient Descent

**Balanced Approach**:

- Uses small batches (32, 64, 128 samples)
- Compromise between batch and SGD
- Most commonly used in practice

**Algorithm**:

```text
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in create_batches(dataset, batch_size):
        gradient = compute_gradient(batch, θ)
        θ = θ - α * gradient

```text
**Advantages**:

- Efficient vectorized operations
- Stable gradient estimates
- Parallelizable
- Good convergence properties

**Batch Size Selection**:

- Powers of 2 for computational efficiency
- Larger batches: more stable, more memory
- Smaller batches: more updates, more noise

## Advanced Optimizers

### Momentum

**Problem Addressed**: SGD can oscillate in narrow valleys

**Solution**: Add momentum term to accumulate velocity

```text
v_t = β * v_{t-1} + (1-β) * ∇f(θ_t)
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α * v_t

```text
**Benefits**:

- Faster convergence
- Reduced oscillations  
- Better handling of noisy gradients
- Escapes shallow local minima

**Nesterov Momentum**:

- Look-ahead variant
- Evaluate gradient at predicted position
- Often faster convergence

### AdaGrad

**Adaptive Learning Rates**:

- Adjust learning rate for each parameter
- Larger updates for infrequent parameters
- Smaller updates for frequent parameters

**Algorithm**:

```text
G_t = G_{t-1} + (∇f(θ_t))²
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α/√(G_t + ε) * ∇f(θ_t)

```text
**Benefits**:

- No manual learning rate tuning
- Sparse gradients handled well
- Automatic learning rate scheduling

**Limitation**:

- Accumulating squared gradients
- Learning rate decreases too aggressively
- May stop learning too early

### RMSprop

**Fixes AdaGrad**: Use exponential moving average of squared gradients

```text
v_t = β * v_{t-1} + (1-β) * (∇f(θ_t))²
θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α/√(v_t + ε) * ∇f(θ_t)

```text
**Advantages**:

- Prevents learning rate from decreasing too fast
- Good for non-stationary objectives
- Works well with recurrent neural networks

### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

**Combines Momentum and RMSprop**:

- First moment (momentum): exponential average of gradients
- Second moment (RMSprop): exponential average of squared gradients

**Algorithm**:

```text
m_t = β₁ * m_{t-1} + (1-β₁) * ∇f(θ_t)  # First moment
v_t = β₂ * v_{t-1} + (1-β₂) * (∇f(θ_t))²  # Second moment

# Bias correction

m̂_t = m_t / (1 - β₁ᵗ)
v̂_t = v_t / (1 - β₂ᵗ)

## Parameter update

θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α * m̂_t / (√v̂_t + ε)

```text
**Default Hyperparameters**:

- α = 0.001 (learning rate)
- β₁ = 0.9 (momentum parameter)
- β₂ = 0.999 (RMSprop parameter)
- ε = 1e-8 (numerical stability)

**Why Adam is Popular**:

- Works well in practice
- Robust to hyperparameter choices
- Efficient computation
- Suitable for most problems
