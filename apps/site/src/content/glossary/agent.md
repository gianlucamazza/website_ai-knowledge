title: Agent (AI)
aliases: ["autonomous agent", "ai agent", "intelligent agent"]
summary: An AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, maintains internal state, and takes actions to achieve specific goals through a perceive-plan-act-observe cycle. Agents can use tools, interact with external systems, and adapt their behavior based on feedback and changing conditions.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a software system designed to operate autonomously in an environment, making decisions and
taking actions to achieve specific objectives. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined paths,
agents can adapt their behavior based on observations and feedback from their environment.

## Core Components

### 1. Perception System

Agents gather information about their environment through various sensors or data inputs:

- Text processing for language-based environments
- API calls to external systems
- Database queries for information retrieval
- Real-time data streams

### 2. Decision-Making Engine

The agent's "brain" that processes perceived information and decides on actions:

- **Planning**: Breaking down complex goals into actionable steps
- **Reasoning**: Logical inference about the current state and potential actions
- **Memory**: Maintaining context and learning from past experiences

### 3. Action Execution

The mechanism through which agents interact with their environment:

- **Tool Usage**: Calling external APIs, running code, or manipulating files
- **Communication**: Interacting with humans or other agents
- **Environment Modification**: Making changes to databases, files, or systems

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

A popular pattern where agents alternate between reasoning about the situation and taking actions:

```text
Thought: I need to find information about the weather
Action: search_weather("New York")
Observation: Temperature is 72°F, sunny
Thought: Now I can provide a complete answer
Action: respond("The weather in New York is 72°F and sunny")
```

### Multi-Agent Systems

Complex scenarios often involve multiple specialized agents working together:

- **Hierarchical**: Manager agents coordinating worker agents
- **Collaborative**: Agents sharing information and tasks
- **Competitive**: Agents optimizing for different or conflicting objectives

## Implementation Frameworks

### LangGraph

A framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with language models:

- State management across conversation turns
- Tool integration and workflow orchestration
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities

### AutoGPT and Similar

Autonomous frameworks that can:

- Set and pursue long-term goals
- Break down complex tasks into sub-tasks
- Self-evaluate and adjust strategies

## Real-World Applications

### Customer Service Agents

- Handle inquiries across multiple channels
- Access knowledge bases and customer data
- Escalate to humans when needed

### Research Assistants

- Gather information from multiple sources
- Synthesize findings into coherent reports
- Track research progress over time

### Code Generation Agents

- Understand requirements and write code
- Test and debug implementations
- Integrate with development workflows

## Challenges and Considerations

### Reliability

- Ensuring consistent performance across different scenarios
- Handling edge cases and unexpected inputs
- Managing errors and recovery strategies

### Safety and Control

- Preventing harmful or unintended actions
- Implementing appropriate constraints and boundaries
- Maintaining human oversight where necessary

### Evaluation

- Measuring agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks
- Balancing autonomy with predictability
- Testing in realistic environments

## Future Directions

The field of AI agents is rapidly evolving, with research focusing on:

- **Multi-modal agents** that can process text, images, and other data types
- **Learning agents** that improve through experience
- **Collaborative frameworks** for human-AI partnerships
- **Specialized domain agents** for fields like healthcare, finance, and education

AI agents represent a shift from passive AI tools to proactive AI partners that can understand context,
make decisions, and take actions to help achieve human goals.
