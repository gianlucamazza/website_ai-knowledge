## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks found in animal brains. It consists of interconnected processing units called artificial neurons or nodes, organized in layers that transform input data through weighted connections and activation functions to produce outputs.

## Biological Inspiration

### Biological Neurons

Real neurons in the brain:
- Receive signals through dendrites
- Process signals in the cell body (soma)
- Transmit output through the axon
- Connect to other neurons via synapses

### Artificial Neurons

Artificial neurons mimic this structure:
- **Inputs**: Receive signals from previous neurons or external data
- **Weights**: Represent the strength of connections (like synapses)
- **Activation Function**: Determines if and how strongly the neuron fires
- **Output**: Sends processed signal to subsequent neurons

## Basic Structure

### Perceptron (Single Neuron)

The simplest neural network unit:

```text
Inputs (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) → Weights (w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ) → Σ → Activation Function → Output
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
output = f(w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b)
```

Where:
- `f` is the activation function
- `w` are weights
- `x` are inputs
- `b` is the bias term

### Multi-Layer Networks

**Input Layer**
- Receives raw data
- No computation, just passes data forward
- Number of neurons equals input features

**Hidden Layer(s)**
- Perform computations and feature extraction
- Can have multiple hidden layers (deep networks)
- Number and size vary based on problem complexity

**Output Layer**
- Produces final predictions or classifications
- Number of neurons depends on task type
- Uses appropriate activation function for the problem

## Key Components

### Activation Functions

Functions that determine neuron output based on weighted input sum:

**Sigmoid**
```
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```
- Output range: (0, 1)
- Historical importance but prone to vanishing gradient

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
```
f(x) = max(0, x)
```
- Most popular in deep networks
- Computationally efficient
- Helps mitigate vanishing gradient problem

**Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
```
f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
```
- Output range: (-1, 1)
- Zero-centered output

**Softmax**
```
f(xᵢ) = e^xᵢ / Σⱼ e^xⱼ
```
- Used in output layer for multi-class classification
- Produces probability distribution

### Weights and Biases

**Weights**
- Represent connection strength between neurons
- Learned during training through optimization
- Control information flow through the network

**Biases**
- Additional parameters added to neuron inputs
- Allow neurons to fire even with zero input
- Improve model flexibility and learning capacity

### Loss Functions

Measure difference between predicted and actual outputs:

**Mean Squared Error (Regression)**
```
MSE = (1/n) Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²
```

**Cross-Entropy (Classification)**
```
CE = -Σ yᵢ log(ŷᵢ)
```

## Learning Process

### Forward Propagation

1. Input data enters the input layer
2. Each neuron computes weighted sum of inputs plus bias
3. Apply activation function to the sum
4. Pass output to next layer
5. Repeat until reaching output layer
6. Compare output with target (loss calculation)

### Backpropagation

1. Calculate error at output layer
2. Propagate error backwards through network
3. Compute gradients for each weight and bias
4. Update parameters using gradient descent
5. Repeat for all training examples

### Training Algorithm

```text
1. Initialize weights and biases randomly
2. For each training example:
   a. Forward propagation
   b. Calculate loss
   c. Backpropagation
   d. Update weights and biases
3. Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations
```
