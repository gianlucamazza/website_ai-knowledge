## Overview

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) represents a groundbreaking family of language models that demonstrated the
power of scaling transformer architectures for natural language generation. Developed by OpenAI, GPT models are trained
using an autoregressive approach where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence, enabling coherent text
generation and diverse language tasks through prompting alone.

## Core Architecture

### Autoregressive Generation

GPT models generate text sequentially, one token at a time:

```text
Input: "The cat sat on the"
Process: P(mat|The cat sat on the) = 0.7
         P(chair|The cat sat on the) = 0.2  
         P(floor|The cat sat on the) = 0.1
Output: "mat" (highest probability)
Next: "The cat sat on the mat"

```text

### Transformer Foundation

GPT uses a **decoder-only** transformer architecture:

- **Causal Self-Attention**: Can only attend to previous tokens, not future ones
- **Position Embeddings**: Learned positional encodings for sequence understanding
- **Multi-Layer Stack**: Deep networks with 12-96+ transformer layers
- **Autoregressive Training**: Optimized for left-to-right text generation

### Masked Attention Mechanism

Unlike BERT's bidirectional attention, GPT uses causal masking:

```python

# Simplified attention mask for GPT

import torch

sequence_length = 4
mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(sequence_length, sequence_length))

## Result: [[1, 0, 0, 0]

##          [1, 1, 0, 0]

##          [1, 1, 1, 0]

##          [1, 1, 1, 1]]

```text
This ensures the model can only use information from previous positions during training.

## Evolution of the GPT Series

### GPT-1 (2018)

### "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training"

- **Parameters**: 117 million
- **Architecture**: 12-layer decoder-only transformer
- **Training Data**: BookCorpus dataset (~5GB of text)
- **Innovation**: Demonstrated that unsupervised pre-training + supervised fine-tuning works

Key insight: Pre-training on large text corpora creates useful representations for downstream tasks.

### GPT-2 (2019)

### "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"

- **Parameters**: 124M, 355M, 774M, 1.5B (multiple sizes)

    # 1. Train reward model on human preferences
    reward_model = train_reward_model(human_feedback_data)
    
    # 2. Use PPO to optimize policy
    policy_model = ppo_optimize(
        model=base_model,
        reward_function=reward_model,
        kl_penalty=0.2  # Prevent drift from original model
    )
    
    return policy_model

Encouraging step-by-step reasoning:

```text
Problem: A store has 24 apples. If they sell 3/4 of them in the morning and 1/3 of the remaining apples in the
afternoon, how many apples are left?

Let me solve this step by step:

Step 1: Calculate morning sales

- 3/4 of 24 apples = 18 apples sold
- Remaining: 24 - 18 = 6 apples

Step 2: Calculate afternoon sales  

- 1/3 of 6 remaining apples = 2 apples sold
- Final remaining: 6 - 2 = 4 apples

Answer: 4 apples are left.
