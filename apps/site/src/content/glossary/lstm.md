## What is Long Short-Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a sophisticated recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the
fundamental limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs can learn long-term
dependencies in sequential data through a system of gates that control information flow, making them highly effective
for tasks involving temporal patterns that span long sequences.

## The Problem LSTM Solves

### Vanishing Gradient Problem in RNNs

**Traditional RNN Limitation**:

- Gradients shrink exponentially during backpropagation through time
- Information from distant time steps gets lost
- Network fails to learn long-term dependencies

**Mathematical Explanation**:

```text
∂L/∂h_1 = ∂L/∂h_T * ∏(t=2 to T) ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1}

```text
When |∂h_t/∂h_{t-1}| < 1, the product approaches zero

**Real-world Impact**:

- RNNs struggle with sequences longer than 10-20 time steps
- Cannot capture long-range relationships in text or speech
- Performance degrades on tasks requiring memory of distant events

### LSTM Solution

**Key Innovation**:

- Separate cell state (C_t) from hidden state (h_t)
- Gating mechanisms control information flow
- Gradient flow through cell state is more direct
- Can maintain information over hundreds of time steps

## LSTM Architecture

### Core Components

#### Cell State (C_t)

**Purpose**:

- Long-term memory of the network
- Information highway running through the LSTM
- Modified only through gated operations
- Allows gradients to flow more easily

**Information Flow**:

- Runs horizontally through the LSTM cell
- Minimal transformations applied
- Gates add or remove information selectively

#### Hidden State (h_t)

**Purpose**:

- Short-term memory and output at each time step
- Filtered version of cell state
- Passed to next time step and output layer

**Relationship to Cell State**:

```text
h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t)

```text
Where o_t is the output gate and ⊙ is element-wise multiplication

### The Three Gates

#### Forget Gate (f_t)

**Purpose**: Decides what information to discard from cell state

**Computation**:

```text
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)

```text
**Function**:

- Looks at previous hidden state and current input
- Outputs values between 0 and 1 for each cell state component
- 0 = "completely forget", 1 = "completely keep"

**Example**: In language modeling, might forget gender of previous subject when encountering a new subject

#### Input Gate (i_t) and Candidate Values (C̃_t)

**Input Gate Purpose**: Decides what new information to store

**Input Gate Computation**:

```text
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)

```text
**Candidate Values Purpose**: Creates new candidate values for cell state

**Candidate Values Computation**:

```text
C̃_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)

```text
**Combined Function**:

- Input gate determines which candidate values to update
- Candidate values propose new information to add
- Together they control what new information is learned

#### Output Gate (o_t)

**Purpose**: Controls what parts of cell state to output as hidden state

**Computation**:

```text
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)

```text
**Function**:

- Determines which parts of cell state are relevant for output
- Filters cell state through tanh and output gate
- Produces hidden state for current time step

### Cell State Update

**Complete Update Process**:

1. **Forget**: Remove irrelevant information

   ```text
   C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1}

   ```text
2. **Add**: Include new relevant information

   ```text
   C_t = C_t + i_t ⊙ C̃_t

   ```text
3. **Combined**:

   ```text
   C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ C̃_t

   ```text
4. **Output**: Generate hidden state

   ```text
   h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t)

   ```text

## LSTM Variants

### Peephole Connections

**Enhancement**: Gates can look at cell state

- Forget gate: f_t = σ(W_f · [C_{t-1}, h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
- Input gate: i_t = σ(W_i · [C_{t-1}, h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
- Output gate: o_t = σ(W_o · [C_t, h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)

**Benefits**:

- More precise timing control
- Better performance on some tasks
- Additional parameters to learn

### Coupled Forget and Input Gates

**Modification**: f_t = 1 - i_t

**Rationale**:

- When deciding to input new information, forget old information
- Reduces parameters and computational complexity
- Often performs similarly to standard LSTM

### Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

**Simplification**:

- Combines forget and input gates into update gate
- Merges cell state and hidden state
- Fewer parameters than LSTM

**When to Use**:

- Similar performance to LSTM on many tasks
- Faster training and inference
- Good starting point for new problems

## Training LSTMs

### Backpropagation Through Time

**Modified BPTT**:

- Gradients flow through gates and cell state
- Cell state provides more direct gradient path
- Gates learn when to pass gradients

**Gradient Flow Advantages**:

- Cell state creates highway for gradients
- Gating mechanism prevents vanishing gradients
- Can learn dependencies over long sequences

### Training Considerations

#### Initialization

**Weight Initialization**:

- Xavier/Glorot initialization for input-to-hidden weights
- Orthogonal initialization for recurrent weights
- Bias initialization often sets forget gate bias to 1

**Forget Gate Bias**:

- Initialize to 1 or 2 to encourage remembering
- Allows network to store information by default
- Network must learn to forget, not remember

#### Gradient Clipping

**Still Necessary**:

- LSTMs can still experience exploding gradients
- Clip gradient norm to prevent instability
- Typical threshold: 1.0 to 5.0

#### Learning Rate

**Sensitive Parameter**:

- LSTMs often require lower learning rates than feedforward networks
- Adaptive optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) work well
- Learning rate scheduling often beneficial

### Regularization Techniques

#### Dropout

**Standard Dropout**:

- Apply to input-to-hidden connections
- Apply to hidden-to-output connections
- Do NOT apply to recurrent connections

**Recurrent Dropout**:

- Variational dropout: same mask across time steps
- Prevents overfitting in recurrent connections
- More complex to implement

#### L2 Regularization

- Apply to all weight matrices
- Prevents weights from growing too large
- Helps generalization

#### Early Stopping

- Monitor validation loss

- Prevents overfitting to training data
