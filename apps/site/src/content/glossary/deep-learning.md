## What is Deep Learning

Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple hidden
layers (typically three or more) to model and understand complex patterns in data. The "deep" in deep learning refers to
the number of layers in the neural network, which allows the system to learn hierarchical representations of data
automatically.

## Key Characteristics

### Hierarchical Feature Learning

Deep networks learn features at multiple levels of abstraction:

**Low-level features** (early layers):

- Edges and corners in images
- Individual sounds in audio
- Character patterns in text

**Mid-level features** (middle layers):

- Shapes and textures in images
- Phonemes in speech
- Words and phrases in text

**High-level features** (later layers):

- Objects and scenes in images
- Semantic meaning in language
- Complex concepts and relationships

### End-to-End Learning

- Takes raw data as input (pixels, waveforms, text)
- Automatically discovers relevant features during training
- No manual feature engineering required
- Learns entire pipeline from input to output

### Representation Learning

- Automatically learns good representations of data
- Discovers hidden patterns and structures
- Transforms raw data into meaningful features
- Creates abstract concepts from concrete inputs

## Architecture Types

### Feedforward Deep Networks (MLPs)

**Multi-Layer Perceptrons** with many hidden layers:

- Fully connected layers
- Information flows forward only
- Good for tabular data and basic classification
- Foundation for more complex architectures

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Specialized for processing grid-like data:

### Key Components

- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect local features using filters
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Final classification/regression

### Applications

- Image classification and recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Computer vision tasks

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Designed for sequential data:

### Characteristics

- Maintain internal memory state
- Process sequences of variable length
- Share parameters across time steps

### Variants

- **Bidirectional RNNs**: Process sequences in both directions

### Transformer Networks

Attention-based architectures:

- Parallel processing of sequences
- Self-attention mechanisms
- State-of-the-art in NLP
- Basis for models like BERT, GPT, T5

### Generative Models

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:

## Training Deep Networks

### Forward Propagation

1. Input data passes through network layers
2. Each layer transforms the data using weights and activation functions
3. Final layer produces output (prediction or probability)
4. Loss is calculated by comparing output to target

### Backpropagation

1. Calculate error gradient at output layer
2. Propagate gradients backward through network
3. Chain rule computes gradients for each parameter
4. Update weights using gradient-based optimization

### Optimization Algorithms

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:

- Updates weights using individual or small batches
- Simple but can be slow to converge

**Adam Optimizer**:

- Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- Momentum-based updates
- Often converges faster than SGD

**Learning Rate Scheduling**:

- Start with higher learning rates
- Reduce over time for fine-tuning
- Helps achieve better final performance
