## What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that analyzes data without labeled examples or target outputs. Unlike supervised learning, which learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns, structures, and relationships within data by exploring the inherent properties and distributions of the dataset itself.

## Core Concept

### Learning Without Labels

The fundamental difference from supervised learning:

**Supervised Learning**:
- Has input-output pairs: `{(x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), ..., (xₙ, yₙ)}`
- Learns to predict `y` from `x`
- Clear success metric: accuracy of predictions

**Unsupervised Learning**:
- Only has inputs: `{x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}`
- Discovers patterns within the data itself
- Success measured by interpretability and usefulness of discovered patterns

### Exploratory Nature

Unsupervised learning is often exploratory:
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Discover unexpected patterns
- **Data Understanding**: Gain insights into data structure
- **Preprocessing**: Prepare data for supervised learning
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new representations of data

### Autoencoders

**Concept**: Neural networks that learn compressed representations

**Architecture**:

- End-to-end training
- Can be adapted for various tasks

**Limitations**:

- Less interpretable than linear methods
- Hyperparameter tuning complexity

## Evaluation of Unsupervised Learning

- **Normalized Mutual Information**: Information shared between clusterings
- **Fowlkes-Mallows Index**: Geometric mean of precision and recall

### Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation

**Reconstruction Error**:
