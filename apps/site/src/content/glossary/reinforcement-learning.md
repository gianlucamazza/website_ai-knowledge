## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make optimal decisions through trial-and-error interactions with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, which learns from labeled examples, or unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in data, RL learns from the consequences of actions through a system of rewards and penalties.

## Core Components

### The Agent-Environment Framework

**Agent**:
- The learner and decision maker
- Takes actions based on current state
- Seeks to maximize cumulative reward
- Maintains and updates its policy

**Environment**:
- Everything the agent interacts with
- Provides states and rewards to the agent
- Changes based on agent's actions
- May be deterministic or stochastic

**State (S)**:
- Current situation or configuration
- Information available to the agent for decision-making
- Can be fully observable or partially observable
- Represents the agent's perception of the environment

**Action (A)**:
- Choices available to the agent
- Can be discrete (finite set) or continuous
- Determined by the agent's policy
- Affects the environment and future states

**Reward (R)**:
- Numerical feedback from the environment
- Indicates immediate desirability of action
- Can be positive (reward) or negative (penalty)
- Agent seeks to maximize cumulative rewards

### The Learning Loop

1. **Observe State**: Agent perceives current environment state
2. **Choose Action**: Agent selects action based on current policy
3. **Execute Action**: Agent performs chosen action in environment
4. **Receive Feedback**: Environment provides new state and reward
5. **Update Policy**: Agent improves strategy based on experience
6. **Repeat**: Continue cycle to maximize long-term rewards

## Key Concepts

### Policy (π)

**Definition**: A strategy that maps states to actions

**Types**:
- **Deterministic Policy**: π(s) = a (specific action for each state)
- **Stochastic Policy**: π(a|s) (probability distribution over actions)

**Policy Optimization**:
- Goal is to find optimal policy π*
- Optimal policy maximizes expected cumulative reward
- Can be learned through various algorithms

### Value Functions

**State Value Function V(s)**:
- Expected cumulative reward starting from state s
- Follows current policy π
- V^π(s) = E[Rt + γRt+1 + γ²Rt+2 + ... | St = s]

**Action Value Function Q(s,a)**:
- Expected cumulative reward for taking action a in state s
- Then following current policy
- Q^π(s,a) = E[Rt + γRt+1 + γ²Rt+2 + ... | St = s, At = a]

**Optimal Value Functions**:
- V*(s): Maximum possible value for any state
- Q*(s,a): Maximum possible action-value
- Satisfy Bellman equations for optimality

### Discount Factor (γ)

- Value between 0 and 1
- Determines importance of future rewards
- γ = 0: Only immediate rewards matter
- γ = 1: All future rewards equally important
- Typical values: 0.9 to 0.99

### Exploration vs. Exploitation

**Exploitation**: Choose actions known to yield high rewards
**Exploration**: Try new actions to discover potentially better options

**Exploration Strategies**:
- **ε-greedy**: Choose random action with probability ε
- **Softmax**: Probability proportional to action values
- **Upper Confidence Bound**: Balance exploration based on uncertainty
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian approach to exploration

## Major RL Algorithms

### Value-Based Methods

**Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**:
- Learn value functions from experience
- Update values using observed rewards
- Bootstrap from current value estimates

**Q-Learning**:
- Learn optimal action-value function Q*
- Off-policy: can learn optimal policy while following different policy
- Update rule: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

**SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)**:
- On-policy TD control algorithm
- Updates Q-values based on action actually taken
- More conservative than Q-learning

**Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:
- Use deep neural networks to approximate Q-function
- Handle high-dimensional state spaces
- Experience replay and target networks for stability

### Policy-Based Methods

**REINFORCE**:
- Monte Carlo policy gradient method
- Directly optimize policy parameters
- Uses complete episode returns

**Actor-Critic**:
- Combine value and policy function approximation
- Actor: policy function (chooses actions)
- Critic: value function (evaluates actions)
- Reduces variance compared to pure policy methods

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
- Constrains policy updates to prevent destructive changes
- Clips objective function to maintain stability
- Widely used in practice

**Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**:
- Guarantees monotonic policy improvement
- Uses trust regions to bound policy updates
- Theoretically sound but computationally complex

### Model-Based Methods

**Dynamic Programming**:
- Requires known environment model
- Policy Iteration: improve policy and value alternately
- Value Iteration: find optimal value function directly

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
- Builds search tree through simulation
- Balances exploration and exploitation in tree
- Used in game playing (AlphaGo, AlphaZero)

**Model Predictive Control**:
- Learn environment model from experience
- Plan optimal actions using learned model
- Re-plan when new information available

## Types of RL Problems

### Episodic vs. Continuing Tasks

**Episodic Tasks**:
- Clear beginning and end (episodes)
- Examples: games, completing routes
- Terminal states end episodes

**Continuing Tasks**:
- No natural ending point
- Examples: process control, trading
- Require discounting for infinite horizons

### Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent

**Single-Agent**:
- One learning agent in environment
- Environment may include other entities (non-learning)
- Focus on individual optimization

**Multi-Agent**:
- Multiple learning agents interact
- Agents' actions affect each other's experiences
- Coordination, competition, or mixed scenarios
- Nash equilibria and game theory concepts

### Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable

**Fully Observable (Markov Decision Process)**:
- Agent sees complete state information
- Current state contains all relevant information
- Optimal decisions depend only on current state

**Partially Observable (POMDP)**:
- Agent has incomplete state information
- Must maintain belief state or use memory
- More challenging but more realistic

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

### Neural Network Function Approximation

**Value Function Approximation**:
- Use neural networks to approximate V(s) or Q(s,a)
- Handle continuous or large discrete state spaces
- Learn complex patterns in value functions

**Policy Function Approximation**:

- Direct policy search methods
- Can handle continuous action spaces

### Advanced Architectures

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:

- Learn spatial hierarchies
- Used in Atari games and robotic vision

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:
- Handle partially observable environments
- Maintain memory of past observations
- LSTMs for long-term dependencies

**Attention Mechanisms**:

- Improve interpretability
- Handle variable-length sequences

Reinforcement learning represents a fundamental approach to learning optimal behavior through experience and feedback. Its ability to learn complex strategies without explicit supervision makes it particularly valuable for sequential decision-making problems where the optimal solution is not immediately apparent.
